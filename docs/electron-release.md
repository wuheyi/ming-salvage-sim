# Electron Release Flow

## Local dev

```bash
cd web
MING_SIM_STEAM_APP_ID=4809750 npm run electron
```

This uses the local Python environment and starts `uvicorn web_app:app`.

For packaging, install the build dependencies once from the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-build.txt
```

## Build backend sidecar

```bash
cd web
npm run backend:build
```

`backend:build` prefers `../.venv/bin/python` when it exists, then falls back
to Python 3.13/3.12/3.11 on `PATH`. Set `PYTHON=/path/to/python` to override.

Output:

```text
build/backend-dist/MingSalvageBackend/
```

## Build macOS app bundle

```bash
cd web
npm run dist:mac
```

Output:

```text
web/release/mac-arm64/MingSalvageSim.app
```

`dist:mac` intentionally disables automatic certificate discovery so local
builds produce a runnable unsigned `.app` without waiting on Developer ID
signing. For a signed local release build, use:

```bash
npm run dist:mac:signed
```

## Build Windows unpacked app

```bash
cd web
npm run dist:win
```

Output:

```text
web/release/win-x64-unpacked/
```

On macOS, a cross-build may also produce a platform-specific folder like `web/release/win-arm64-unpacked/`.
For a real Steam Windows upload build, prefer the native Windows GitHub Actions job so the backend sidecar is also built for Windows.

## Steam upload target

- macOS depot: upload the whole `.app`
- Windows depot: upload the full contents of `win-*-unpacked/`

Do not upload `web/dist`.

## GitHub Actions

Native per-platform Electron builds are defined in:

```text
.github/workflows/electron-release.yml
```

This is the recommended way to produce:

- macOS `.app` with macOS backend sidecar
- Windows `win-x64-unpacked/` with Windows backend sidecar
