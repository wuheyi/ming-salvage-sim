## 后宫预设图池（`consort_pool_<N>.png`）

后宫**不做逐角色专属立绘**。妃嫔由大模型在选妃/册封时动态生成（姓名、性情、才艺都是 LLM 发挥），
不可能预先为每个人画图。改用**预设图池**：

- 文件命名 `consort_pool_1.png` … `consort_pool_20.png`（共 20 槽，纯编号，不绑人名）。
- 代码 `db.next_pool_portrait_id("consort_pool_")` 顺序分配下一个空槽给新妃嫔，存入 `portrait_id`。
- 前端按 `portrait_id` 取 `/portraits/consort_pool_<N>.png`，缺图回退占位符。
- content 开局 5 位后宫（周皇后/周贵人/田贵妃/袁贵妃/慧妃）已预绑 `consort_pool_1`–`5`。
- 现有 16 槽（pool 1–16）已出图；**pool 17–20 待补**，照本段风格基底续生即可，主体随意（多样化更好）。

> **要点**：池图只需**风格统一、人物多样**（不同气质/服色/身份），不必对应任何具体妃嫔。
> 越丰富，选妃时撞脸概率越低。

**现代古风风格基底**（每条 prompt 末尾统一加）：

> beautiful young woman with modern aesthetic facial features, refined delicate features, large bright expressive eyes, natural light makeup, flawless porcelain skin, elegant Ming dynasty hanfu, semi-realistic illustration style, soft cinematic lighting, ethereal beauty, ArtStation trending quality, full-body standing portrait, white background, vertical composition 3:4, ultra high detail, masterwork quality

**调性**：保留明制汉服骨架，脸型/妆容/气质走现代审美——精致五官、自然妆感、清爽不浮夸、高颜值。
画风偏唯美插画 / 半写实游戏 CG，弱化古画质感。
